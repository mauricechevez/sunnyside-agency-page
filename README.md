## About this project
This is a landing page for an imaginary creative agency called "Sunnyside". It has a desktop and mobile design. 

### Challenges
I must admit, this was a bit challenging. I was learning SCSS while creating this, which was helpful in that regard. Learning about nesting and variables helped make the coding of the CSS a bit cleaner, but I must admit, I probably nested too many things.
